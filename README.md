# Add2Cart
Cart sharing and group ordering for shop experience in the Telco Applications.

## **Overview**

This project aims to streamline the upgrade and purchase process within e-commerce applications, especially in the context of telecom apps. It allows a primary account holder to share their cart, device upgrade plans, or product selections with multiple account holders (e.g., family members, friends) in real-time. By integrating cart-sharing features, the app facilitates easy collaboration between users on upgrades and purchases without manual coordination outside the app.
