# Add2Cart
Cart sharing and group ordering for shop experience in the Telco Applications.

## **Overview**

This project aims to streamline the upgrade and purchase process within e-commerce applications, especially in the context of telecom apps. It allows a primary account holder to share their cart, device upgrade plans, or product selections with multiple account holders (e.g., family members, friends) in real-time. By integrating cart-sharing features, the app facilitates easy collaboration between users on upgrades and purchases without manual coordination outside the app.

## **Features**

1. **Cart Sharing & Group Ordering**:
    - Share your cart with other account holders via a link, QR code, or NFC.
    - All users can view and modify the cart in real time.
    - No login is required for shared users to access and change the cart.

2. **Real-Time Updates**:
    - All changes to the shared cart are reflected in real-time for all participants.
    - Ensure a seamless, collaborative shopping experience.

3. **Multiple Products Support**:
    - Add, update, or remove multiple products from the shared cart.
    - Other users can modify the same cart simultaneously.

4. **Notifications (Good-to-Have)**:
    - Notifications are triggered when users make changes to the cart.

5. **In-Cart Notes or Chat (Good-to-Have)**:
    - Users can leave comments or chat within the cart to discuss products and upgrades.

6. **Analytics and Insights (Bonus)**:
    - Track metrics like cart sharing frequency and the average time to complete group orders.

7. **Multiplatform Support (Bonus)**:
    - Cross-platform compatibility with web, Android, and iOS.

8. **Innovative NFC Cart Sharing (Bonus)**:
    - Use NFC capabilities for quick, innovative cart sharing on mobile devices.
